Created this project using Bootstrap and SASS! This is meant to show my ability to do website development and to show off my skills!

I will be periodically updating this website, especially whenever I do something that is worthy of noting.
I know for sure I will need to go back and recode this, and I have aspirations of recoding this site using Tailwind CSS for more control over the design.
I do need to keep practicing my skills, and hopefully I'll get better with time.
